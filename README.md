Forsaken-Mail
==============
A self-hosted disposable mail service

### Installation

#### Setting up your DNS correctly

In order to receive emails, your smtp server address should be made available somewhere. Two records should be added to your DNS records. Let us pretend that we want to receive emails at ```*@subdomain.domain.com```:
* First an MX record: ```subdomain.domain.com MX 10 mxsubdomain.domain.com```. This means that the mail server for addresses like ```*@subdomain.domain.com``` will be ```mxsubdomain.domain.com```.
* Then an A record: ```mxsubdomain.domain.com A the.ip.address.of.your.mailin.server```. This tells at which ip address the mail server can be found.

You can fire up Mailin (see next section) and use an [smtp server tester](http://mxtoolbox.com/diagnostic.aspx) to verify that everything is correct.

#### Let's Go

```
